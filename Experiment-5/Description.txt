Dynamic Product Filter

A web based dropdown that allows users to filter products based on categories (like Electronics, Clothing, etc.). 
Updates the product list instantly without reloading the page.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
JavaScript logic :

const products = […]
Stores all the product data as an array of objects.
Each object has name and category. Example: { name: "Shirt", category: "Clothing" }.
This acts as the main dataset that filtering will be applied to.

function displayProducts(filteredProducts)
Takes the filtered product list as input.
Clears any existing items in the product list area.
Loops through filteredProducts and dynamically creates list elements to display them.

document.getElementById("filter")
Selects the <select> dropdown element from the HTML.
Helps JavaScript detect which filter option is currently chosen.

filter.addEventListener("change", … )
Listens for a change event when the user picks a category.
Triggers the filtering process immediately without refreshing the page.
Ensures the displayed products match the selected option.

const filteredProducts = products.filter(…)
Uses the .filter() method to create a new array of matching products.
If "Clothing" is selected, only products where category === "Clothing" are kept.
If "All" is chosen, no filtering is applied, and the full list is shown.

productList.appendChild(li)
Appends each matching product (as a <li> element) into the product list.
This step visually updates the page with the new filtered results.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
HTML 

<select id="filter">
A dropdown menu that lets users choose the product category.
Categories include "All", "Electronics", "Clothing", etc.
Acts as the input control for filtering.

<ul id="productList">
An unordered list where filtered products are displayed.
Each matching product is inserted as a <li> inside this list.

<option value="all">
A special option that resets the filter.
Displays all products regardless of category.

<div class="container">
Groups the dropdown and the product list into a single box.
Makes the layout look clean and organized.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CSS

.container
Adds padding, border, and background to create a neat section.
Makes the filter UI stand out from the rest of the page.

select
Styles the dropdown with padding and border.
Ensures it looks clickable and user-friendly.

ul li
Each product is displayed in a list format.
Provides spacing and clean typography for readability.
