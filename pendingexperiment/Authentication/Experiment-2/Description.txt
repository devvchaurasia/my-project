### Experiment 2: The Super Secret Club Pass
(Full-Stack JWT Authentication)

What my code does:
This is like a **Secret Club**. If you want to come back tomorrow, you need a special pass.
1. I built two parts: a **Front Door** (my React app) and a **Secret Guard** (my Node.js server).
2. When you type your name and secret word into the Front Door, the Front Door sends them to the Secret Guard.
3. The Secret Guard checks a list. If you are on the list, the Guard doesn't just say "OK." It gives you a **special, secret ticket** called a **JWT**.
4. The Front Door saves this special ticket in the browser's memory.
5. Now, to see the **Secret Room** (the protected page), the Front Door has to show that **special ticket** to the Secret Guard every single time.
6. The Secret Guard looks at the ticket to make sure it's real. If it's real, you get in! If you try to sneak in without a ticket, the Guard yells: **"401 Unauthorized!"**
